#Instructions to install all the automation components


For the project assigned, I choose to create a maven project for which I used IntelliJ. The components I had to install for writing my automation script was Selenium and TestNG. Since, I created a maven project I had pom.xml file where I added all the dependencies that are required for me to write my automation test script and then execute the tests.
I went to https://mvnrepository.com/ and then I search for selenium which I added to my pom.xml file that would help me to write my automation test scripts. And then I added TestNG to my pom.xml file that would help me execute my test cases using the Annotation “@Test”.

And I also, downloaded the chromedriver.exe from google and added to my project so that my tests would be executed in the chrome browser.


#Instructions to execute the automated tests

To execute the automated test cases, I added TestNG to my project in pom.xml file. I created a testing.xml file from which I could execute my automation test scripts. To execute the automation scripts, right click on testing.xml file from any IDE and select run which will execute the test.
